# BookDatabase
A sample app that demonstrates CRUD operations using express and python.
The "database" used in this program is a json file (`db.json`). Python (`requests` library) is used to send requests to the server (node.js using `express`).

## To be added
Hosting a website that interacts with the server, instead of using a python script. I plan on using flask, but that may change.
